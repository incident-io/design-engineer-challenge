# Design Engineering Take Home Task ‚ú® üèóÔ∏è

This is a simple boilerplate for the incident.io Design Engineering take home task.

The Figma file you've been sent contains the brief as well as guidance on constraints, variants and more - please look out for this in your inbox!

Don't worry too much about the current codebase itself - we've included a few libraries we work with heavily (React, Tailwind, Framer) by default, but otherwise been relatively unopinionated. Please use whatever libraries, tools or techniques you're most comfortable with to complete the task. We want to see your best work.

The goal is to solve the problem the most intuitive and polished way you can - the details and final touches are entirely up to you. The Figma file is a good starting point but feel free to experiment and improve on it, if you think it would help or make things feel more magic ‚ú®.

There's a mock API library in `src/api/scribeClient.js` if you want to test out the interactions using it to simulate the API during development.

## Installation and Development

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
